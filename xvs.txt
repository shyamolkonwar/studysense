MVP Project Description: Mental Health & Study-Stress Analyzer
Executive Summary
The Mental Health & Study-Stress Analyzer MVP is a next-generation Generative AI platform designed to proactively monitor student well-being by analyzing social interactions, messages, and digital activity patterns. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and dynamic AI agent tool calling, it provides early alerts for stress and mental health risk, actionable emotional insights, and context-driven support recommendations. The objective is to empower both students and institutions with timely, personalized interventions that promote well-being and academic productivity.

Problem Statement
Rising academic pressure and post-pandemic challenges have led to a surge in mental health issues among students, with significant percentages experiencing moderate to severe depression, stress, and anxiety. Traditional surveys and self-reporting are insufficient for persistent, early interventions. There’s an urgent need for an AI-driven solution that continuously synthesizes digital behavioral signals to identify and address stress at its root, while protecting user privacy and autonomy.​

Phases to build:

Phase 0: Ethics, consent, and scope
Define non-clinical positioning, risk communication, and escalation boundaries to avoid clinical claims in the MVP while offering evidence-informed support and early-warning signals for study stress.​

Implement explicit opt-in consent, granular data scopes (messages metadata vs. content), retention policies, and a clear privacy dashboard for revocation and data export.​

Limit initial integrations to low-friction, well-documented providers (e.g., Google Calendar, Slack, Canvas/Moodle) to de-risk OAuth and event ingestion at MVP scale.​

Phase 1: Domain model and data contracts
Entities: User, Consent, IntegrationAccount, Message, Activity, Conversation, RiskScore, Alert, Recommendation, Resource, Embedding, and AuditLog with clear ownership, PII boundaries, and purpose binding.​

Storage: PostgreSQL for relational data; ChromaDB collections for knowledge base and per-user context vectors; S3/MinIO for static KB assets and anonymized exports.​

Message schema (normalized): id, user_id, source, timestamp, channel, direction, content_hash, content_redacted, sentiment, embeddings_ref, and risk_features to support incremental reprocessing without duplicating raw PII.​

Phase 2: RAG knowledge base and retrieval
KB content: coping strategies, CBT/mindfulness snippets, campus resources, crisis policies, and study techniques curated into markdown/pdf with chunking at ~500–800 tokens, semantic titles, and YAML frontmatter metadata.​

ChromaDB collections: kb_global, campus_resources, and user_context with embedding model parity across indexing and query, plus metadata filters for campus, locale, and topic.​

Retrieval pipeline: query -> semantic expand -> hybrid metadata filter -> rerank -> cite top-k chunks, following RAG best practices for groundedness, recency, and domain constraints.​

Phase 3: Provider-agnostic LLM and agent layer
LLM service interface: generate, chat, embed, and moderate methods, switchable via config for OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini/HF local with streaming enabled for chat UI responsiveness.​

Agent layer: LangChain/LangGraph graph with tools for calendar_events, messaging_fetch, lms_deadlines, resources_lookup, and notifications, with execution traces for auditability and reproducibility.​

Guardrails: retrieval-augmented prompts with explicit citation slots, instruction hierarchy, and moderation checks to mitigate hallucinations and sensitive-topic mishandling in mental health contexts.​

Phase 4: Analysis and risk scoring engine
Text processing: sentiment (VADER), emotion tagging, stress lexicon features, and burstiness/frequency signals per channel and timeframe for early anomaly detection.​

Behavioral features: study-hour patterns (calendar + LMS), deadline proximity, message response latency, nocturnal activity, and peer-interaction variance to detect workload-induced stress spikes.​

Risk score formula: combine standardized features with decaying time weights and personalized baselines, e.g., 
R
t
=
σ
(
w
s
⋅
S
t
+
w
e
⋅
E
t

d
 ⋅D 
t
 +b) with percentile-based adaptive thresholds for Low/Mild/Moderate/Severe/Crisis classes.​

Recommendations engine: RAG-grounded tips, campus resources, and small-step action plans aligned to risk class and user preferences with explainability via retrieved evidence snippets.​

Phase 5: Alerts, escalation, and notifications
Policy-driven rules: threshold crossings, slopes (trend acceleration), and multi-signal corroboration before alert emission to reduce false positives.​

Channels: in-app banners, email, and optional SMS with rate limiting and quiet hours, plus opt-in counselor notifications with explicit per-student consent.​

Escalation: crisis wording with hotline and campus helpline cards, and zero-content forwarding (metadata only) to maintain privacy while nudging timely human contact.​

Phase 6: Backend services (FastAPI)
Services: auth, users, analysis, chat, alerts, resources, integrations, and admin analytics with dependency-injected repositories and typed Pydantic schemas.​

Tasks and schedulers: Celery + Redis workers for ingestion, batch analysis, weekly KB refresh, and daily trend recomputation to keep API latency low.​

Streaming: Server-Sent Events or websockets for chat and live dashboard updates, with backpressure handling and retry policies.​

Phase 7: Frontend app (Next.js)
App router structure: auth, dashboard/overview, insights, chat, resources, settings, and admin/analytics/alerts, with server components for data pages and client components for interactive charts.​

State and data fetching: TanStack Query for server state, Zustand for UI state, and SSE streams for chat; optimistic updates for resource bookmarks and preferences.​

Visuals: stress trend lines, mood heatmaps, activity timelines, and alert cards with drill-down to evidence snippets and “why am I seeing this” explanations for transparency.​

Phase 8: Integrations and tool connectors
Calendar: Google Calendar OAuth, read-only events, deadline clustering, and exam-window tagging to enrich stress context.​

LMS: Canvas/Moodle token-based API for assignments and grades metadata only, avoiding content scraping to reduce risk footprint at MVP stage.​

Messaging: Slack/Teams workspace-scoped read of user’s messages metadata and allowed channels, with optional redacted content sampling for sentiment to respect privacy.​

Phase 9: Security, privacy, and compliance guardrails
Data minimization: default to metadata and embeddings where feasible; encrypt PII at rest and in transit; rotate keys; and segment secrets per environment.​

RBAC and audit: role-based access (student, counselor, admin), action logs for agent tool calls, and immutable audit trails for alerts and risk score decisions.​

Legal: GDPR-grade consent flows, data export/delete, and DPIA-lite documentation to demonstrate responsible data handling in demos and judge Q&A.​

Phase 10: Evaluation and QA plan
RAG quality: retrieval precision@k, groundedness rate, and citation accuracy tracked via small adjudication sets seeded from the KB.​

LLM behavior: refusal/guardrail tests on unsafe queries, style and empathy checks, and answer consistency under paraphrase using a lightweight eval harness.​

Product metrics: alert precision/recall (with user/counselor feedback loops), latency SLOs for chat and dashboard, and feature ablation for risk scoring robustness.​

Phase 11: DevOps and environments
Environments: dev/staging/prod with Docker Compose locally and IaC-ready containers for cloud; structured env vars and secret management per environment.​

CI/CD: lint, type-check, unit/integration tests, container scan, and one-click staging deploy with smoke tests and rollback plan to ensure demo reliability.​

Observability: Sentry for errors, Prometheus/Grafana for metrics, and request tracing to diagnose agent and retrieval bottlenecks during load.​

MVP deliverables by module
Data & RAG: curated KB, embedding jobs, ChromaDB collections, and retrieval API with citations in responses.​

Agent & LLM: provider-agnostic LLM adapter, agent graph with calendar/LMS/resources tools, and execution tracing API.​

Analysis & Alerts: sentiment/emotion pipeline, risk scoring job, and alert policy engine with notifications and audit logs.​

Frontend UX: dashboard, insights timeline, RAG-cited chatbot, and settings/consent pages with accessible, youth-appropriate design choices.​

Admin UX: cohort heatmaps, alert review queue, and anonymized trends reporting for program steering, not surveillance.​

Key workflows (end-to-end)
Student onboarding

Auth -> consent scopes -> connect calendar/LMS -> seed baseline week -> dashboard ready with initial risk and study trend tiles.​

Daily ingestion and analysis

Scheduled connector fetch -> normalize -> NLP features -> update risk score -> trigger alerts if thresholds crossed -> refresh dashboard tiles.​

Chat and recommendation

User opens chat -> agent runs RAG retrieval with context -> LLM responds with cited tips and resource links -> user can bookmark or set reminders.​

Admin review

Admin sees aggregated risk heatmap -> opens flagged student (with consent) -> reviews evidence and trend slope -> sends nudge or schedules outreach.
